## Contribution Guidelines

### Code Conventions

#### General

- Use const instead of function. (**arrow function** instead named)
- **Export default on the bottom** of the line of codes.
- Props is named as is (no need to be prefixed with component name).
- No need to import React. (React 17+).
- Prioritize using Tailwind classes, before making custom CSS in CSS modules.
- Use `isSomething` for Boolean.
  > \*Can be simple condition or event function of checking something
- Use `onEvent` for Event props.
  > \*i.e. Prefix handle of event function with `onChangeUserData`, `onSubmitUserData`.
- Use `kebab-case` for URL or slug.
  > \*i.e. `?/first-step-onboarding`
- Query params use `snake_case`.
  > \*i.e. `/path?step=1&sub_step=2`

#### Typing and component name convention

- For components, better rename the components to `CardProductSpecial` or something else that are more descriptive. Don't just use `ProductSpecial` or `Product`.
  > Rule of thumb: in a pinch, use the suffix `ComponentSomething`.
- Functional (react) component, files, and folder name use PascalCase.

- Basic function or hooks using camelCase.

- Attribute field from API use snake_case.

### Which folder should I put my component in?

If you start with an empty project and you have design system, then you can start with the components that are in the design system.
If you don't have a design system, you can start with common components and put the component inside the `components` folder.
For example button, input field, etc. These components are expected to be used in multiple places in the application.
You should not put the component that only used in one or two places in this `components` folder.
You also should not put the component that has a specific business logic in this `components` folder.
You can put these components in the folder where they are used in `routes` folder.
If one day you need to use this component in more that two places, you can move it to the `components` folder if it is **[pure component](https://react.dev/learn/keeping-components-pure)**,
or you can move it to the `features` folder if it has a specific business logic.

### What is the `features` folder?

The `features` folder is where you put the **reusable components that have specific business logic**.
For example, you create a collaboration app that has several views such as Timeline, Backlog, Board, User Task List, etc.
`UserTaskDetail` is a component that shows the detail of a user task. A user task detail can be viewed from each view as a sidebar detail or a modal detail.
This means you can put the `UserTaskDetail` component in the `features` folder because it has certain business logic and can be reused in many places.

### What is the `hooks` folder for?

If `helpers` folder is for the reusable functions, then `hooks` folder is for the **reusable stateful functions** or [custom hooks](https://react.dev/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks).
For example, you have multiple table components that have the same sorting and filtering logic. You can put the sorting and filtering logic in a custom hook and put it in the `hooks` folder.

### What is the `contexts` folder?

`contexts` folder is intended for the **[app level context](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context#before-you-use-context)**.
For example, you have a theme context, user context, etc.
You can put the context provider and context consumer in this folder.

### Should I put all type definition in the `types` folder?

No. You should put the component specific type definition in the same folder as the component.
This folder generally contains data types from external services or represents the application data model.

### How to write documentation for the component?

- Create a story file alongside the component file with the filename `ComponentName.stories.tsx`.
- Import your component, then define the metadata and the story.

```javascript
import type { Meta, StoryObj } from '@storybook/react';

import ComponentName from './ComponentName';

const meta: Meta<typeof ComponentName> = {
  component: ComponentName,
};

export default meta;
type Story = StoryObj<typeof ComponentName>;

export const Default: Story = {
  args: {
    // define the component props here
  },
};

export const OtherStateOfComponent: Story = {
  ...Default,
  args: {
    ...Default.args,
    // define the specific state of the component here
  },
};
```

- You can use the `render` attribute to control how the component is rendered in the story. You can also use it when you need to demonstrate the stateful behavior of the component.

```javascript
import { useArgs } from '@storybook/preview-api'

...

export const Default: Story = {
  args: {
    value: "",
    // other props
  },
  render: (args) => {
    const [{ value }, updateArgs] = useArgs<{ value: string }>()

    return <input {...args} value={value} onChange={(e) => updateArgs({ value: e.target.value })}/>
  }
}
```

- You can add `tags: ['autodocs']` to the story metadata to enable the [auto-generated documentation](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-docs/autodocs) feature.
- If you want to create documentation for a component that uses react-router, you need to add `decorators: [withRouter]` to the story metadata. More information about this addon can be found [here](https://storybook.js.org/addons/storybook-addon-react-router-v6/).
- By default, storybook add extra padding in the preview panel. You can configure the [story layout](https://storybook.js.org/docs/configure/story-layout) by changing the `parameters.layout` attribute in the story metadata.
- You can also set a default viewport for the story by adding `parameters.viewport` attribute in the story metadata. For example:

```javascript

const meta: Meta<typeof ComponentName> = {
  component: ComponentName,
  decorators: [withRouter],
  parameters: {
    layout: 'fullscreen', // will remove extra padding in the preview panel
    viewport: {
      defaultViewport: 'mobile1'
    }
  }
};
```

- Sometimes we want to demonstrate a component behavior based on the service response. You can mock the service response using [Mock Service Worker](https://storybook.js.org/addons/msw-storybook-addon/).

```javascript
import { rest } from 'msw'

...

export const Success: Story = {
  parameters:{
    msw: [
      rest.get('https://api.example.com/data/detail', (req, res, ctx) => {
        return res(ctx.json({ id: 1, name: 'John Doe'})) // your service contract
      }),
      rest.post('https://api.example.com/data', (req, res, ctx) => {
        return res(ctx.json({ message: 'Your data has been submitted' }))
      })
    ]
  }
}

export const InvalidData: Story = {
  parameters:{
    msw: [
      rest.post('https://api.example.com/data', (req, res, ctx) => {
        return res(ctx.status(400), ctx.json({ message: 'Invalid data' }))
      })
    ]
  }
}

```
